# Showcase

This repo hosts tests that make sure that applications present in the Packager [showcase](https://packager.io/) are working properly, on all target distributions.

## How it works

It launches micro EC2 instances, and can run expectations on SSH commands, and/or by launching a real browser to make sure the application is working.

Installation recipes can be found in the `data/` folder.

## Usage

Setup dependencies:

    bundle install

Setup environment variables:

    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY="xxx"
    export AWS_SECRET_KEY="yyy"
    export AWS_REGION="zzz" # defaults to us-east-1

Launch the tests:

    bundle exec rspec spec/
    # or
    bundle exec rspec spec/ -e "specific example name"

If you're writing new tests, it is probably good to NOT terminate the EC2 instance after each test, so that you can re-run the test and it will reuse the same instance instead of launching a new one. Use `DEBUG=yes` to do this:

    DEBUG=yes bundle exec rspec spec/ -e "specific example name"

## Tested applications

* Gitlab - <https://packager.io/gh/gitlabhq/gitlabhq>
* Discourse - <https://packager.io/gh/pkgr/discourse>
* OpenProject - <https://packager.io/gh/opf/openproject>
* Gogs (Go Git Service) - <https://packager.io/gh/pkgr/gogs>

## TODO

* [ ] Parallelize tests.
